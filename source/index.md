I am a sculptor working predominantly in ceramics, textiles, wire and natural/found materials - creating sculpture for myself, exhibitions and public spaces. My work responds directly to environment and its history. Animals also reoccur in my work - dominant in my life their presence and beauty remain a constant inspiration to me.
